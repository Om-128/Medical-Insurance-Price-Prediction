# Medical Insurance Price Prediction – End-to-End ML Project

A complete machine learning solution to predict medical insurance charges using various regression models and ensemble learning techniques. The project is built as a modular, scalable Python application, containerized using Docker, and deployed on AWS EC2 with an automated CI/CD pipeline.

---

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

This project predicts medical insurance costs based on user data such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region. It integrates exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model training with robust evaluation metrics. Multiple models are compared, with ensemble techniques like Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost being used to improve prediction accuracy.

The entire pipeline is packaged into a deployable application using **Docker**, continuously integrated and deployed through **CI/CD workflows**, and hosted on **AWS EC2**.
